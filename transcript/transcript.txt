0m3s: I don't think alright just like a movie alright
0m10s: what what what what am I looking at you look at me as well
0m17s: sure yeah let's see reprogram the leader
0m22s: silence my phone call he had that car and comments like Parker
0m27s: now that
0m50s: alright let's start out with just storytelling you were asked to do a tribute album belsavis version like the media like a remix started it because of the
1m1s: they did a remix album ten years prior because it came out all six some like that
1m6s: so five some like that %HESITATION so I look ten years
1m12s: later let's do another remix album and I was already already scored the movie score the music for the mouth miles ahead movie
1m19s: so some of people Sir are involved both Vince Wilburn in
1m23s: some of the cuts involved both
1m25s: the movie and this remix thing is a state you know so
1m28s: go ahead Robert you wanna do you know you want the remix
1m31s: I was like colossal Marty miles mode
1m35s: that's a Coltrane song by the way come out
1m39s: spirit it limited limited in Wales RD miles mode and %HESITATION so let cool
1m46s: do it so but I want to do it the seller remix album
1m51s: azalea
1m53s: was this a more in depth than a remix psychic must remix things you know you it's pretty much the same day
1m58s: sample four bars could hip hop beat to it as a remix album you know
2m3s: paper wrapper on it remix and you've heard that before you know
2m8s: you've heard mas's music before so my main thing was I wanted to try to make new compositions
2m15s: based off of his recordings old recordings ends
2m19s: sample some successful some stuff that you probably never heard
2m23s: so I asked if I can go in the vault and get the multi tracks you know to
2m27s: a lot of albums and %HESITATION
2m30s: I play around in those is try to come up with some different songs
2m33s: and you know mix of stuff together and
2m37s: write some lyrics of the people and show new work to show the inspiration
2m42s: status and house
2m44s: because for me as a hard is when people are now
2m47s: %HESITATION
2m50s: whatever you wanna call if people want to show gratitude towards me
2m54s: some people say Hey row about my band plays a song and that's cool you know or recorded just now and I feel great about thanks man that's awesome with someone says I wrote a song inspired by you that's deeper
3m7s: you know I mean that means much more
3m9s: so that's kind of where I was in the headspace that was it with this
3m14s: where do you start like alright she got
3m17s: the vault imagining I got extra volume and mima do besides Smith we we walked in there
3m24s: with which I think we went twice each time we spent
3m28s: hours and hours and there are probably six seven hours
3m31s: in there just listening the stuff and saying okay give me that
3m35s: and asking the pull up certain records will play the sound man
3m39s: seeing how many seeing house recorded because some
3m43s: some recordings were only to track or three track some recordings right eight track
3m49s: so
3m50s: that that tells you how many instruments for those will not tell you how many instruments are separated into recording so you can literally just isolate the piano drums trumpet or whatever it is
3m59s: you know so
4m0s: there was that process that is just so much music can get through it Austin having gotten through all the stuff I have you noticed too much music I could be five remix albums off of what I don't what I got just that you know
4m12s: so we went in there and they were there twice a lot least six hours each time as listen to things and
4m19s: tell them what we wanted and
4m21s: give us that gives that gives that you know to me and then I was like okay now we have a list of what we do with it so much
4m28s: that's what I do I don't know a soul on intimate like a million Bucks
4m33s: as you can see my jackets awesome %HESITATION safe %HESITATION
4m38s: no we %HESITATION
4m41s: just I just lived with it for a minute you know and went through things and
5m0s: the stuff and then you know certain certain ideas apartments in my head you know with certain things like just maybe was something that was just a drumbeat I took in a little on the edge of the
5m11s: and the drums were isolated so I could take just the drums is like how
5m14s: yes
5m14s: so I have that and then I was like okay I'll put some of the stuff way on top of it you know I'll make up something and play on top of that
5m21s: so some of the tracks are mixture of myself with the recordings
5m25s: of miles or myself and I had like great bassist Derek Hutch
5m30s: play on some things and you know that I was like I said I will involve like you know
5m37s: singers on certain things to write lyrics on a well structured thing so that was made to think so first I listen to listen to what I have and I would just
5m45s: jot down ideas a charter member and try to write down exactly where
5m49s: it was on the time stamp you know Blanco drums here
5m53s: three ninety three you know on this outtake track
5m57s: three if you throw it right there up and I just had a list of that of where these dope little little little snippets affirm that I knew I could I kill them like a loop
6m9s: a long game make into songs you know that was the first day
6m13s: either it was most rising get a walk actually
6m27s: Genoa that's Astana never really made it to the light of day
6m31s: %HESITATION I have the
6m34s: because there's a lot of the songs on these recordings that
6m38s: you know they started to be songs with those that are on their way will finish it later %HESITATION instead of going to stick
6m44s: you know he'd love to get the studio and make up stuff in the studio
6m48s: you know %HESITATION and so you listening throughout these tapes you hear so many
6m55s: little musical snacks namely that
6m59s: nobody else is hurt you know and stuff that could have been awesome song by they just never got back to it he went on to something else you know
7m8s: %HESITATION and get awhile ago so dope you know
7m14s: I got the concept quick because the name was already there was called get a walk
7m18s: and those chord changes that sample so
7m26s: they lend themselves to hip hop so well you know
7m31s: cool you're gonna say something yeah you came out of the beginning
7m44s: nnj and nbsp nnj actually your impulses yeah he says the watch
8m2s: paying nnj right so what would soon you heard about what was going through
8m20s: I just when I first heard them two chords I was like I remember me was how really studio my boy on this place in Harlem and we heard those two core can we
8m29s: we will go sometimes go the studio and put put on the sessions
8m34s: sit around and drink and just listen until we both love and this came on we always ask how
8m43s: internet you know those like just those two chords by itself full moon
8m49s: so right off top of like that's it
8m52s: if that was good that you know codicil hip hop you know me
8m56s: it's all hip hop is so now in the name of the song gotta walk is so there were so many
9m1s: ideas %HESITATION conceptually to do with the name of it
9m7s: as well as the feeling that %HESITATION that recording gave
9m14s: a feeling of
9m15s: either so I news going to be something though and I'll write off topic here below on it easy you know I mean it was cool because I can use it use that song as a platform to talk about some of the stuff going on in the
9m28s: in the world right now %HESITATION
9m31s: you know so I just it all just worked with those with that
9m34s: one piece recording so many things
9m37s: hit me at once I'll go back where you know I I know you
9m41s: what do you buy so hip hop well just the way %HESITATION
9m47s: this the harmony %HESITATION
9m51s: the harmony in the way that it sounds the the texture of the
9m56s: %HESITATION the way
10m0s: that was with the way that was recorded and how rough it was recorded
10m5s: good back then use mikes on everything you know now everything's literally Mike's every piece
10m10s: of everything is Mike so there's no mistake as no mystery
10m13s: to anything anymore so a lot of times you miss
10m17s: you miss a lot of %HESITATION
10m19s: feeling from it because it sometime things that a mysterious creek filling
10m23s: so the feeling but everything's equally
10m27s: Mike the same way then this not the feelings gone now life you'll have to recreate feelings with the mikes
10m33s: you know into recruited filament that has a feeling on its own because
10m38s: they you know %HESITATION
10m41s: they don't have thirty five mikes up you know getting every piece so you hear you hear his voice
10m47s: fatally you here you know the horns coming from the back you know the drums aren't necessarily in your face with it dislike it almost sounds like it's two mikes in the room
10m58s: and you get that edges created like a whole fig arises here I heard dirty drums in though
11m5s: under
11m6s: of top so that that's what I meant by hip hop like a Sutil hipaat like a you know New York
11m14s: old school leading New York hip hop like dirty DJ premier
11m18s: tight hip hop you know made that that's what I heard as soon as I heard this
11m22s: because select freak out you hear less nnj very early on
11m35s: they're from there was like okay let's get that boom now this
11m40s: %HESITATION what what's I got that %HESITATION
11m46s: we actually took that I was like okay let's put that I want to put that in
11m49s: put that away we have it Karelin leave listening for something else were listening for
11m55s: some other stuff mouse talking about some stuff
11m58s: that her once before I could remember where it was
12m0s: and we ran across this online eat before we get what we need them to take this
12m5s: and I remember this bow so where do this was a ticket to DC
12m9s: to avoid Jill's house
12m11s: Jules is a %HESITATION beat maker from DC that I work with
12m15s: %HESITATION that worked with on a few different projects and we work really well together
12m20s: %HESITATION so %HESITATION good to his crypt
12m25s: and he immediately did what I did when I played it form of sly watched
12m30s: he's like I don't need any help out of it any producer will go crazy for the thing that
12m36s: that little piece so
12m38s: he immediately her without her that he's like all my guys whom dirty jobs idea either
12m42s: so %HESITATION he went into this thing and and the
12m48s: we tried a few different things %HESITATION but
12m52s: he founded he found this one he he made this one jump out and I was dumb but that we just we just messed with a little bit and just came up with the right job have the fitness
13m1s: %HESITATION actually why and nbsp har and nbsp I know that nnj
13m20s: that's me well
13m35s: we got the drums so no jewel's lays layers on drums yeah and then I
13m42s: I was just please also drives and then I was
13m44s: while he was doing that
13m47s: I was just singing trying to come up with the vibe of the hook
13m50s: and that's not came out with get a walk in
13m52s: I came out with a good a lot is that even the words after that outside turn at the moon
14m0s: then remove the commode they can hold me the girl walk is over the thing that
14m6s: we know what he looked them drums and
14m9s: that's what a concept of Saul really came together and now
14m15s: you know we had that so I Li I I made a little demo myself seeing that idea
14m20s: you know and then
14m22s: I was gonna said Isabella but I was like here to listen to
14m26s: I'm awake until he comes to see
14m30s: I thought you were exactly right on the spot he Legolas moving before him
14m33s: so I go back to the York
14m37s: Lacob allowed Mrs lego when can you come by
14m40s: come by the studio mean he came here to come and buy
14m44s: and I just played him the joint the idea
14m48s: the first thing he did was write the rest fill in the lyrics
14m51s: you know so gotta walk him streets to find me
14m56s: %HESITATION devils watchin you know %HESITATION
15m4s: and then he he was on and wrote the rest of the chorus and then
15m9s: well the various and then the got on the Mike and
15m15s: kill it like he always does and I was able to pursue dnmt
15m21s: she's the phone devils will mention they can hold dnmt
15m32s: she's to fern dnmt devil's workshop dnmt you know you know and I didn
15m42s: we should do our own like we did on my album blue
15m46s: blablacar area %HESITATION would move love
15m51s: we should do a thing we put the stems up and let people do remixes
15m54s: forget a walking I have a remix contest or something
16m0s: you can take that right now you know I didn they'll be awful
16m6s: yeah but the store looking at everybody loves this like this every every I just let those seven week European tour everywhere I went of the DJs and those that you know
16m16s: hip hop hits like Yoko I couldn't do it you know and like I said is so hip problem in
16m21s: blouse will help up it's just like to have the stems for this catheters
16m25s: kids don't have the originals also like you because of that exactly
16m31s: totally awesome I got a walking I'll talk about another track
16m37s: so you heard that sample yet and you're like alright that over here a little scream no you let
16m43s: like you was that we saw a big rat if you another room
16m47s: that's a lot how was that told talk about the vote what legal vocals
16m54s: even the one plane earlier on the sofa
16m57s: was that %HESITATION yeah %HESITATION southern song I did with legacy
17m2s: and John Scofield Kagome
17m8s: wait a minute no we called I'm leaving you
17m11s: the sex of their mother and leaving it right I'm leaving you
17m14s: so the thing about this is I found this track on the
17m19s: on the but I want to the vault I got this
17m29s: and nbsp jn well you hear mouth talking over this
17m48s: your mouth talking over this jungle then again into just got a good color little
18m17s: little I mean you gotta let it carry you I mean is that he's
18m23s: young who inability county a lemon and album as well later
18m28s: so this then I heard the rest of the song you had a base commented on that guitarists
18m34s: brown here it and nbsp it is
18m54s: so when I heard that when I heard that later imminently the minute outlet all that's something that's going to be so all you have to cut back on the job that that's already top that's already layer myself
19m6s: you know so
19m8s: when I heard the weather anyway to me to have the idea Hey let's make that the courts
19m12s: so let's make him
19m13s: part of the chorus saying wait a minute because my idea for this whole thing was it
19m17s: for you to hear trumpet on every
19m20s: track so you'll know it's Miles Davis you know and
19m23s: because for me you know need the trumpets of the fine miles
19m26s: you got it made here is bigger than the instrument
19m29s: you know and a lot about what he represents has nothing to do with the instrument at all
19m34s: and most times when you talk about Miles Davis and some others remix album with
19m38s: you know a trumpet record you know everybody the reality is anybody doesn't identify with the trumpet northerly when he heard the trumpet on every song becomes a becomes a failing and becomes a thing about that
19m49s: so my thing was as what it
19m51s: incorporate the essence of miles how whatever that means on every song whether it's him hand claps
19m58s: whistling his talk
20m0s: and because the somebody out his trumpet or just the composition he wrote you know like all these different things you know %HESITATION so every chance going to have something different from miles on it healer me so this is one of those things where I was like ok is a big dope
20m15s: such as a corporate his voice and his whistling on this on
20m19s: my fat missive a habit I think this might be the same track
20m25s: I took his whistling sn gn como Jibon mom there is
20m56s: mtn then why didn't it and I just looked it
21m5s: you know and then I added base then I just
21m16s: so we gotta build a song around the the way to me
21m20s: I'm nndb and I have another after that
21m25s: I'm leaving you and I need somebody that had like a very
21m28s: sassy attitude he kind of singer
21m33s: there were two things I came to my mind was shocked that legacy
21m37s: you look at me so %HESITATION
21m40s: so I can and shock and miles are friends you know and
21m45s: they've done stuff so I was I was like let me I want this whole thing I want to be something different I don't want to do anything that you've already heard ours are deep into
21m53s: because miles when they wanted to do that he's always about to exit the has not been done
21m57s: he's not about regurgitating any
21m59s: so I have to be in the spirit of him when I made this which is why a lot of people like how can you saw so he worked with mouse you should use this producer he did stuff for miles back in the eighties like yet of the whole point he already did it so now there are these people who never worked in my house
22m14s: because that's a mouse would do he wouldn't go back to work with this guy started been dead so in the true spirit of miles
22m20s: have to move up and Cuba so that's what I was thinking in my mind so I said well let me just without the legacy
22m27s: I know saga of psychobilly because his legacy seal so that
22m31s: and I was like
22m32s: course right away you know so I threw it away and I would steal a legacy alerted here it
22m40s: %HESITATION access that this tour prior so she can like mess around some lyrics and I'm saying so she could not have been there when I got there
22m47s: it was and you know we just work it out there in the studio to finish that up and
22m53s: bom
22m54s: became that and then I then I said you know let let me
22m58s: let me add one element of %HESITATION
23m3s: I felt like I should maybe add one element of somebody who
23m7s: is around now that they were miles
23m10s: to bring everything around I what the whole project the do that about like when the college town still feel good I just saw him
23m16s: in Europe somewhere that we always talk about doing something together
23m20s: maybe I'll do something we got to some
23m22s: so then I was like oh means are just about doing something I haven't a guitar solo on this
23m27s: you know I mean so I think that would be dope and bring it bring it all around so
23m31s: %HESITATION John Kennedy York
23m33s: %HESITATION he had he had a show I think you came
23m35s: in the afternoon before his show or something and later I actually have jet to go back to Europe
23m41s: when John came to the studio and live play guitar solo in person with guitar down
23m46s: so it was it was it was cool core %HESITATION alright let's talk about violence
23m52s: yes because that's on the internet right now you've listened to a lot meaning of souls a story behind behind that track
24m1s: okay so so sorry to sample more like like I saw subzero blue and green because of the song blue and green from
24m9s: kinda blew up in my house most critically acclaimed album
24m13s: I was still is the number one jazz selling album selling jazz
24m17s: esta metal album to this date it beats me other gestures
24m22s: whenever I get a number one I'll stay there for a little while but didn't trust a belief kind of blues coming up to the egg so one of my favorite songs
24m32s: about time really of jazz to this
24m35s: off a record called blue green really really busy it's only ten bars
24m40s: she's also cool about it is really really short just loops
24m46s: and %HESITATION
24m47s: when I went to the vault I found I knew that there was only one actual full
24m55s: recording of it like one take full take and most people
25m0s: this song has been covered before the fondant sample before a lot actually
25m5s: but they all sample from that one take and when you hear you know is this
25m9s: but I found three false starts so I thought I found
25m14s: some parts were Bill Evans play the intro and then miles let out we will wait and they start talking
25m20s: and in the middle again so the essential slightly different
25m24s: you know what I mean so that's why I use the intra slightly different
25m28s: and the and this is such a beautiful this
25m31s: bill's touch on there so it is so beautiful and you know I'm a piano player some you know mythographer that
25m37s: beautiful courtesan
25m39s: lesson this you know honor I have not got the right sample and I
25m43s: only I don't buy tickets at the original if this
25m55s: normally let's the superstar I mean more about
26m9s: so what we do we have to we have to we just had to %HESITATION
26m13s: we have to add a little bit chop it up into a little bit to make it
26m18s: longer and slow it down a little bit
26m21s: you know so have slowed down and then chapter a little bit to make
26m24s: certain parts fall on certain parts of the beach you know
26m28s: to give that certain films you know %HESITATION
26m32s: but that was pretty much divided by I didn't want this song I do want this all to be over produced I wanted to be led by just the piano like piano bass drums because
26m42s: that's to me what makes the song so beautiful as the
26m45s: how %HESITATION how are sparse everything is not a lot going on
26m53s: you know I mean and so
26m56s: %HESITATION but that's what made a beautiful solid to keep that feeling I got from the original what I bring to help upside I do what I call these keyboards and you know
27m5s: key base you know awhile as want to be elephant like the original
27m9s: as possible and then throw find tales out of
27m13s: you know almost as if he's rhyming although almost as it nonstop playing enough Artes in our
27m19s: this is a little bit out of me like you get the same feeling almost as if you're
27m24s: they are the actual recording so that was my purpose
27m27s: for how I made the track sound so I just took that
27m31s: sample and I flew to South Carolina no North Carolina
27m37s: %HESITATION
27m37s: my boy knife wonder and and fun to live there
27m42s: and I went in with life one day and I I gave him the
27m46s: the %HESITATION the sample
27m49s: and we just kind of went through a few different Pete's
27m51s: that shows the one ally he he still he did maybe three different beats that shows that when they use their
27m56s: I was like yeah I like them that was the
27m59s: you know in that we certified to know then I came back to New York actually certified today came back to New York that a monthly basis %HESITATION Burness Travis he played bass on
28m10s: and nothing too much you almost don't even realize is based on
28m13s: just like the original you know realizes much based on just has recorded some of that was that I didn't make it like Bumi based like some hip hop you know I really want to try to capture the same building that was my purpose
28m25s: and then you know
28m27s: five it is magic he's a he's he's a magical MC's are my favorite top probably top five
28m33s: rappers as far as though especially as a freestyle and stuff you know to me
28m38s: and he's one of the very few rappers that can actually releasing
28m41s: and arrive actually releasing rap like you know so
28m46s: that would that that that's what was cool about this so I came again to like
28m50s: pretty much look like that until the deeper on if you
28m54s: so all this is a little while back but I really like
28m58s: if you know such a nice touch yeah agree about
29m2s: touch our hearts explains like %HESITATION
29m8s: Islam is the equivalent of a voice like when somebody says they have a nice time
29m12s: you know like Lou some people talking this will be smoother
29m17s: the voice is really the or they have a certain way of
29m21s: saying words of certain
29m23s: so we have say syllables or whatever it is that makes them how they talk sound the way doesn't entices you
29m28s: it's kinda like how it is on
29m31s: but estimates of the way like this how you literally play
29m35s: court on the piano there's ten fingers you could play ten notes at one time
29m41s: there's a way different ways you can play those ten those
29m43s: and there are certain calculators I can hear them play
29m46s: accord I could be like oh that's just by the way
29m52s: they literally approach playing their touch on the on the actual question
29m56s: it's I think touches the gift you know touch is necessary talent
30m0s: you can learn how to play good
30m3s: everybody play good legal are to play good to me just how
30m6s: I can play good the gift is the thing you can't practice
30m11s: you get a certain well I'll be computer at practice
30m2s: touching someone like playing visit making someone cry you know you can't practice that that's just you have to you don't have it
30m8s: you know and Bill Evans and Fisher yeah well the art so
30m15s: the lyrics on the side it'd %HESITATION
30m18s: we were involved in that at all was a it's going to town very
30m22s: notice him because he's a he's a music head and he knew
30m25s: like for this project only messed with people who really do miles
30m29s: and they were actually fans I didn't go for
30m33s: you know the huge names so I could have sold millions of albums it was literally a one of this to be a labor of love
30m40s: you know and I wanted to come out that way feel that way not just a bunch around the people singing mouth Davis yeah you have like a lot of Miles Davis references in the house told her about how you can see
30m52s: and that's what he he is that you know I mean I've had conversations with him about mouse
30m56s: before before I even knew this project is coming you know so
31m0s: yeah I just knew he was the guy for this period you know me and and %HESITATION
31m5s: I let him go I do you tell them what to
31m8s: glyphosate what to do anything I'll just let go you know you got it gonna have the producer you have to know when to shut up you know and some producers don't know when the set up and they want to produce overly produced everything and that's when the project doesn't come out
31m24s: as authentic and
31m26s: great as you want it you know knowing when the set up is also just as important is no one to talk
31m32s: her I actually the good like a grizzled it from
31m38s: you're working with all these a lot of miles I
31m49s: just exactly here is my head over this was %HESITATION
32m1s: wasn't **** the jazz listener how it
32m6s: I don't expect the jazz listen there too and my other cousin
32m14s: of what good it should it goddammit **** cook %HESITATION
32m19s: testing Veatch %HESITATION no I
32m24s: is them we're talking a mile Davis I can't think I got it because
32m30s: welcome this was not for the jazz world %HESITATION
32m37s: that tends to be the problem sometimes when people try to cross over and
32m42s: do things they still tried to pee they still tried to they still try to
32m50s: do something that
32m51s: the jazz were still going to like and it's hard to
32m54s: it's hard to as both audiences you know what I mean
32m59s: to me it's pretty it's a required unit tell the jazz were no more about Miles Davis
33m4s: at all they get it done you don't mean this cut out will make them mad
33m10s: which is fine I don't give a damn could I for you
33m14s: you know I mean it's for these people who don't know miles who've heard his name
33m19s: probably you'd be surprised how many people use their mouths they don't know who the hell you talking about
33m23s: you're talking about twenty zero right now
33m25s: if they got future in that I cut the pie don't have Miles Davis and
33m30s: you know I mean reality of it so
33m33s: you have to think of it like that I think of it like this
33m36s: what are the odds of you going your grandmother and asked her if she knows future
33m41s: and then on top of that let's go further Asker's she knows
33m44s: slow you know what I mean luck I'm going to work out for you
33m50s: you have to flip it around like that sold the reality of it is
33m53s: when you go to the twenty year old a twenty five year old enough that they probably don't know any songs don't know what he plays anything so my point was to make music that they already
34m5s: understand
34m7s: you know I mean so they can digest it better
34m10s: and then they don't know that they're they're just a mouse you know to me they don't is not subject to throw like I say it is not
34m16s: trumpet
34m17s: twenty four seven on that level you know I mean but I did it in the way that
34m23s: they understand period I spoke their language
34m27s: which is also my language you know I speak I'm bilingual musically so many people are not
34m32s: and that's the problem
34m34s: Spanish they just keep talking to you while you're in Spanish allow you talk does make Milstead Alexander
34m39s: you know I mean but if you bilingual you talk to everybody
34m44s: that was awesome just made that up submitted
35m0s: god course victors estimate as to the tank still do my will why why would chose
35m10s: because
35m11s: yeah I say that they probably will hate the album because in their mind this none of my house in
35m16s: wise in my house
35m17s: I had a jazz cats we me that he's like other than mouse talking at the very beginning of this
35m23s: why is it wise it what what where's my logically miles
35m27s: those people who don't understand %HESITATION it's not surface
35m33s: the mouse is an obvious I'm not handing it to you on a platter like here's miles
35m38s: you know but the track is miles he wrote it
35m41s: he produced it
35m43s: you know I mean %HESITATION that's him clapping that's a listening that's him talking
35m48s: that's this was his idea
35m50s: this was inspired by him all those things is why economy by so many people are just listening for the muted trumpet either a hook or if I don't hear that all is no mouse either me then that's not that's not the case
36m4s: you know to me that's it Mao's the equivalent or almost of a of a in in a in a way of a Quincy Jones you don't need to hear trumpets and though Quincy Jones produce a bunch of stuff in his
36m14s: wrote about stuff and
36m16s: conceptualize a bunch of things you know even though he was a trumpet player you can take the trumpet of the picture
36m22s: you can do the same thing with my house you know I mean he was responsible for so many different styles of music
36m27s: different areas and pushing the envelope and
36m29s: responsible for so many musicians doing what they do and giving them the thought to do what they do you know I think Herbie would be as far along as he was as he is
36m38s: without having somebody I mouse look up to you know I mean so to me it's a lot deeper than just that
36m45s: you know is there a track where I feel like
36m48s: no joke around here that that moment where the hip hop fan
36m53s: get introduced to miles away that year she would have never of like had miles on is
36m58s: phone you know
36m59s: is there a track we really feel like you you have an educational
37m4s: moment there for for a listener I think the first track is awesome yeah councils talking shit
37m12s: hold it up
37m15s: we move on to another you know on violence we got %HESITATION
37m20s: on that I use blue green
37m23s: thinking sound by wise for you I think you'd be wise to have Roberts a fully on violence we used a sample from blue green look very got you know just as a as a self contained by okay one about what we will do that
37m36s: okay %HESITATION
37m39s: actually I don't know if I have this on the CD or maybe there was a title change
37m44s: coworker talking shit
37m46s: %HESITATION did that on your computer we can just like political nnat nnat
37m55s: mt mt Jill kitchn nnj if you think
38m20s: this isnt mouth licking her problem saying he didn't know was called hip hop cdn one of the poles but not to entertain you know
38m31s: mylex when you our primary people didn nnj nnj and nbsp
38m57s: what
38m58s: where's the sample and where did I start with a truck
39m1s: kind of what we did with %HESITATION walk and violence
39m5s: so the first thing we found was the talking
39m8s: when I got when I got to the vote the one thing that was that I think probably the dope is thing of of all about being in the vaults
39m16s: and getting the multi tracks
39m18s: was here and communicate with other musicians because that's something you just don't hear on the album is really you know you hear every blood in the song to him talking to Tito sound guys that is or say something you know
39m29s: but
39m30s: they're full blown conversations are here and him you get to see a little bit of his personality in the studio and most you know get nobody sees that polis here in the studio
39m39s: you know I mean so this is one of the one of the things where I just I took
39m44s: along sample of him just talking
39m46s: giving directions and talking and and how he was having fun cousin up attacks you know it is alway and and how he would explain how he wanted certain things
39m57s: %HESITATION as a producer how he heard
40m0s: and things and the way he would explain it and then they would get
40m3s: you know those are things like you know see how does being made ever enough but now you see
40m8s: is being made so I think that was the the cool thing about it is I want to make a that's why I use that as a whole track the very first things Takis it you know because he's a startlingly
40m18s: just talking about different things a studio and talk to the guys
40m22s: you know I thought that was a nice eye opening
40m24s: experienced a lot of people you said %HESITATION this hip hop without him realizing it was here because of the because he's like Hey
40m33s: he's talking to Joe chambers in the drummer and you say
40m36s: you know play something that's a pulse but less that tainted to tainted today because
40m41s: most people I think of jazz to think of swing that when you take a swing at the chain to entertain tent
40m47s: if you
40m47s: change that you know the jazz world goes crazy you know we're doing such as you know genesis one rhythm you know what
40m55s: %HESITATION so he wanted a pulse
40m58s: that repeated over and over again that was meditative
41m1s: but that was it tend to entertain Ted today so
41m5s: when I heard him say that I like
41m7s: %HESITATION doesn't that mean jewels again Mauboy jewels out I was like it was thought to be there
41m13s: so we came away to be but then we sampled
41m19s: to Korea on this on this session can member session this was exactly
41m24s: but those core such a career plan legal going political going legless chicory trickery of the piano player of the it's a career he's %HESITATION
41m35s: %HESITATION one of the most famous awesome Chanticleers that was came up and miles is banned along with Herbie
41m41s: so a lot of the sessions have Miles Davis armies have have to Korea and Herbie Hancock on piano
41m46s: on the electric pianos and somebody's recordings are
41m50s: the very first time that these kinds of a play electric candles like roads and all the different things you know
41m55s: so there's the the main piano players on these recordings
41m59s: that I use for this album modules I want all
42m2s: Korea Herbie Hancock %HESITATION Bill Evans is on the plane agree
42m8s: %HESITATION Keith Jarrett was in there somewhere
42m13s: in these recordings you know I mean but those were the power the powerful for
42m17s: people that he used in that in that in that way
42m22s: %HESITATION alright so you rules played on the PC yeah
42m27s: %HESITATION the sounds pretty sure yes just lose lose like a long interlude it's only like three minutes or something three or nine your measles like it just gives you a glimpse
42m37s: and two miles is
42m39s: personality so then you get a vibe that I think that's a good
42m43s: told said it for the rest of the album we had a personality so then
42m47s: what made me so then I said okay he said something about playing the bass
42m55s: and I won that's what I actually got home mn
43m4s: go and nbsp you kn well you leann a nd
43m17s: and nbsp leann hundred round out the title track beautiful
43m26s: he said the right here nnj the nd nndb the
43m43s: nndb occur with Islam pander to mount plate before this is a
43m47s: that's what I was like well you know and let me get a bass player in here to play
43m52s: the place I call my boy Derek hives the
43m55s: with a recording artist in please when in my band as well %HESITATION
43m59s: I got the paper based on it but then the cool thing about is from this thing that's why god everything's beautiful because he said nnj
44m9s: nnj and nbsp if you the nnj right yes nnj
44m32s: nnj nnj
44m38s: let him talk her down yet because of the big administration notice he look he they were playing in the studio and theres estimate that one of the guys in Miller works
44m47s: and he's like see you see that you only know that isn't that organ you know that is his life but guess what everything's beautiful
44m54s: everything's beautiful so he he was basically said I think that
44m58s: you know you can find something music clean everything back in
45m2s: it is beautiful people in the right place you know how to put it in there is can be beautiful but everything's beautiful views on the whole you
45m8s: you know it's like spice you know me use the right space for the right things beautiful beautiful Ralph thing is absolutely horrible
45m16s: either %HESITATION alright let's talk about one more track that you're
45m21s: psyched about yeah I about should it got a law
45m32s: him another one that you really feel %HESITATION mesas though yelled Sakata because that's the
45m41s: yeah so %HESITATION
45m44s: first thing I did was last Erica she would do it
45m48s: off topic when I first got the call to do this
45m51s: because I know she was miles in any big Erica FedEx like
45m55s: used to walk out on stage
45m56s: on with the miles that single mouse Davis song first tours
46m1s: %HESITATION Sokol so what she would change it to buy do
46m5s: so what would you do believe do but I do pretty good with the the %HESITATION either of them and I was
46m13s: back in the nineties you know I mean so I felt like there will be a dope
46m19s: person that has to do it
46m21s: and I love working with her she's really creative and fun to work with so
46m25s: evergreen before so I Harrop issues down to do it definitely
46m30s: %HESITATION
46m32s: so let me do this is we went that we flew down to Dallas mean Rashad Smith
46m36s: flew down to Dallas %HESITATION he actually works with her life
46m41s: plays in a band
46m43s: those are pretty busy work our band stuff and produces
46m46s: but her pain
46m47s: %HESITATION with her of so we we flew down to Dallas
46m53s: and we could deflect for days so
46m59s: with certain people use of the work organically is not one of them things when you go in and we got it out of the studio let's get it done
47m6s: Benegal robotic that it'll work with some a lot of people so I knew lists
47m11s: kind of an eye for few days so
47m14s: we got in a few days and we ended up just
47m16s: really chill at her house a lot drinking wine and
47m21s: listening to my house album she had mad mouse records
47m24s: so we just said now listen the miles makers and drug one
47m28s: just I think we came up with something and then she was like you will have another one until one into a bus
47m35s: I was a little box to to know that okay
47m38s: so we thought about what basa tunes miles did
47m41s: or a passive door to look a change in the buses
47m44s: you know %HESITATION but we came up with the saw mice at a record
47m48s: %HESITATION that's of the Basra esque Bob %HESITATION so
47m56s: we got multicenter eye colour Steve Berkowitz and ask them
48m0s: first look out of his Wilburn and as events what the boss to tune them out of the he's like well myself enough that I'll snap so we pulled above that yes I love the stuff I got about I forgot about that soon you think about this album is not all surface mouth who's not that
48m14s: the songs you've always heard if there's some very underground decide sounds and hears about which is the sort of scope of his
48m21s: work at home so anyway that color Steve Berkowitz and the
48m28s: Steve is over well because the yeah
48m39s: okay yeah he's like and our person producer he can he can get us things
48m44s: %HESITATION
48m47s: you have the miles of state %HESITATION so he can get us think so
48m51s: he got he got me the motives by the very next day
48m56s: and
48m57s: we went to studio in Dallas Erica has dope studios who uses that we went to there and they have all the super vintage keyboards
49m5s: super vintage Perot was amazing to be in there
49m9s: we just took some of those motives that they send us
49m12s: and then we put our own beat to it says so you some of the sample
49m17s: put our own beat to it
49m19s: leave me Eric comes in without even went to the Mike and play percussion
49m23s: as a percussion stuff happening and then %HESITATION the
49m27s: so anyway we have that foundation that we call Braylon in her bass player
49m31s: to play bass on it so we have the musical foundation
49m35s: so then the cool part about the song is that the whole time it every time in there to get together to play this game by two player that's less he said
49m43s: you know
49m44s: you have to the game excited about this game so in other words if anybody says something
49m52s: that could sound sexual well the end you don't mean that to sound social but you said in the south actually say well that's why she's
49m59s: you know if you ask me right now how how long is it yeah
50m3s: the lobby legacy system either or the record room exactly slip book we were joking without all the whole time we were down there
50m11s: and
50m12s: even at the studio we just kept doing it like that was just the thing and then she just ended up being
50m17s: the songs OC level writing the lyrics based on that
50m21s: that's what she said so that's why the songs because so long but it parenthesis
50m27s: that's what she said
50m29s: or in some like that that's what it says right yeah yeah you have like
50m33s: sure
50m34s: then all I have I'm sorry Maeser in this this along a parenthesis yes yes along and purposes yeah but that that's what we get it from so if you need us to the lyric
50m44s: you'll hear that ongoing that on Craig's out that's what she said and I obviously that's something I feel bad joke was around back then and I think miles weekly
50m54s: so they would play the game %HESITATION %HESITATION she wanted to ones
51m2s: a silent way %HESITATION I'm just curious personally about so we just
51m8s: quickly
51m11s: this track seem to be more of not a vocal or small clip actually a big part of the like
51m17s: I like a real long sample in someway Xenu like really remixing the track him so that he can talk about where this liberates the song you know
51m27s: and actually it's trumpet which like one of the few tracks HMM
51m32s: %HESITATION so yeah over in a silent way track
51m35s: wells sounds is where I think we might have a title change on the version I
51m39s: %HESITATION noble silence is the way the name of the track now
51m42s: yeah but the sample comes from in a silent later I had the weird titles on my right right right so this the sample comes from
51m50s: the the session is album he has caught in a silent way so we took the samples from the sessions of in a silent way and then
51m58s: %HESITATION we came out we had a
52m3s: you may play it yeah so I put a little bit
52m7s: outside the stencils on trumpet dnmt embrace the whole track office carpet
52m15s: so and I %HESITATION nnj and nbsp that Holden wrote Frederick trumpet
52m33s: Facebook unnamable for the whole song is built occurs no
52m42s: it's not a good so we have held it they got there
52m48s: and then sample both keyboards parts from but we sampled those keyboard parts dnmt
53m1s: stop running no not what I did was
53m8s: the track was done first most of the track now
53m11s: first and then
53m13s: %HESITATION I had the idea of having Laura mobile looks
53m16s: he's a great vocalists in the UK and %HESITATION
53m24s: I actually went out to London to do a show
53m28s: and so we purposely kind of
53m30s: from %HESITATION schedule it's where to stay another day
53m33s: and going to studio with her to do this so
53m38s: she came in and listen to it because you hear before has listened to it literally wrote lyrics right there
53m46s: wrote her vocal arrangement house because she's a composition major
53m50s: she wrote her vocal arrangement out
53m52s: I recorded it and then I threw up appear on the wanted after she finished
53m56s: you know it's very organic process
53m59s: but that's pretty much where they came from I think this trumpet riff and then when he gets a certain no I help the riff let it go throughout the whole song
54m6s: and then I just sampled
54m9s: %HESITATION keyboard part %HESITATION fixed schedules Alamo on that on that
54m14s: %HESITATION it was the look that
54m17s: you know me and then just let her come on top of it and just play and saying
54m21s: at the vibe too you know
54m23s: %HESITATION how do you go about finding a sample and you know the track at a time
54m27s: I didn't it was the part it will be with this whole process I did have certain things in mind really I'll just listen and then something will be let us know
54m36s: are they all listening
54m38s: probabilistic sessions there because so many of these things we're not from
54m43s: finished a mile song saw lot of stuff I've never heard before and it was just like aw what's that
54m48s: in this great finding some of those like finding goes like all men
54m52s: I have this
54m53s: nobody else has this will use this you know
54m56s: and that's what made it cool too you know
54m58s: this finding content that is not already out there really you know and using that
55m3s: %HESITATION
55m5s: so it was just it was just a super don't process
55m9s: you know I'm still finding stuff out when I was a Baptist
55m0s: stuff out I haven't even gone through all so
55m4s: I read my brain so I just kind of what I find some I kind of just try to wrap my head around it do some with it because other than that I just be listening
55m12s: and bill all this all this to myself isn't all of this that you know never get anything done
55m18s: you know cool I I feel good about we went over missing
55m27s: violence will be yeah for that one by violence okay I'm gonna yet also for the song violets
55m33s: %HESITATION we used I got that from the record kind of blue
55m38s: and the song is on blowing green so
55m41s: I use that a false start Lenka intro that they they use for it
55m46s: %HESITATION from blue and green the song violence Greg there wasn't a little intro
55m52s: hell yeah individual
56m0s: %HESITATION as you know if you're sure once you
56m3s: beyond the apparatus yeah I mean I don't either but but yours truly probably absoluta so let's do I don't know they were doing anything else of this material umps maybe will wants to cut a video I don't know I I feel like we should get it because I think that's a good point and yours truly videos yeah one stool intro alright yeah
56m25s: who are you mn does what you want %HESITATION %HESITATION so this is going to be like a eyes Robert Glasper
56m33s: we made this album as a tribute I'll stick I guess it's
56m38s: the introduction for someone who has no idea okay that's it
56m44s: my name is Robert Glasper my piano player producer sign the Blue Note records
56m51s: I think this album is a tribute to Miles Davis
56m54s: kind of a reimagining of using some awesome artist today
57m1s: because everything is beautiful
57m7s: she stresses he said you know I mean like I don't but I feel you I got you know working here union men in that I think it was a letter
57m15s: exactly dnmt
57m19s: earlier get in there given and that's a season dnmt boom
